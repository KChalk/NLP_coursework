A copy of most of the contents of my final project folder for my NLP class. 

The project: classify phonological representation of aphasia related speech errors using LSTMs. Analyze results and machine weights using t-SNE mapping.

Of Note: many functions and files were inspired by code written for previous homeworks and were not renamed or documented clearly. I reccomend relying on html, and pptx files rather than trying to interpret the code.
Also: this code will likely not run as much of the data has been removed due to medical data privacy concerns.
